# CONTROL STATEMENTS

## Control Structures in Javascript

In Javascript, control structures are the building blocks that allow you to dictate the flow of execution within your program. Here are the main control structures in Javascript:

1. **Sequential Structure**: This is the default structure, where statements are executed one after another in the order in which they appear in the code.
2. **Selection Structures**:
    - **if statement**: It allows you to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true. You can also use `else` to specify an alternative block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
    - **switch statement**: It allows you to select one of many blocks of code to be executed, based on the value of a variable.
3. **Repetition Structures**:
    - **while loop**: It repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
    - **do-while loop**: It is similar to the while loop, but it ensures that the block of code is executed at least once before checking the condition.
    - **for loop**: It repeats a block of code a specified number of times, typically iterating over a sequence or collection of data.

Let's expand on each of these with examples in Javascript:

- **if statement**: It's used for decision-making in the program. For example:
    
    ```
    if (condition) {
        // code to be executed if condition is true
    } else {
        // code to be executed if condition is false
    }
    
    ```
    
- **switch statement**: It's useful when you have multiple conditions to check against the value of a single variable. For example:
    
    ```
    switch (expression) {
        case constant1:
            // code to be executed if expression matches constant1
            break;
        case constant2:
            // code to be executed if expression matches constant2
            break;
        default:
            // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
    }
    
    ```
    
- **while loop**: It repeats a block of code as long as the specified condition evaluates to true. For example:
    
    ```
    while (condition) {
        // code to be executed repeatedly
    }
    
    ```
    
- **do-while loop**: It's similar to the while loop but ensures that the block of code is executed at least once, even if the condition is false. For example:
    
    ```
    do {
        // code to be executed repeatedly
    } while (condition);
    
    ```
    
- **for loop**: It's used when you know the number of iterations beforehand. It consists of initialization, condition, and update expressions. For example:
    
    ```
    for (initialization; condition; update) {
        // code to be executed repeatedly
    }
    
    ```
    
- **for...in loop**: It iterates over the properties of an object. For example:
    
    ```
    for (let key in object) {
        // code to be executed for each key in the object
    }
    
    ```
    
- **for...of loop**: It iterates over the values of an iterable object, like arrays or strings. For example:
    
    ```
    for (let value of iterable) {
        // code to be executed for each value in the iterable
    }
    
    ```
    

These control structures give you powerful tools to manage the flow of your program, making it possible to create complex and dynamic behavior.

### Let's break down each control structure in JavaScript with step-by-step simple code examples and explanations. I'll add comments and numbers to help guide you through each part of the code:

### Sequential Structure

```jsx
// 1. Declare a variable and assign it a value
let x = 5;

// 2. Print the value of the variable to the console
console.log(x);

// 3. Increment the value of the variable
x++;

// 4. Print the new value of the variable to the console
console.log(x);

```

### Selection Structures

### if statement

```jsx
// 1. Declare a variable and assign it a value
let y = 10;

// 2. Check if the value of y is greater than 5
if (y > 5) {
    // 3. If the condition is true, print a message to the console
    console.log("y is greater than 5");
} else {
    // 4. If the condition is false, print a different message to the console
    console.log("y is not greater than 5");
}

```

### switch statement

```jsx
// 1. Declare a variable and assign it a value
let fruit = "apple";

// 2. Use a switch statement to perform different actions based on the value of fruit
switch (fruit) {
    // 3. If fruit is "apple", print a message to the console
    case "apple":
        console.log("This is an apple");
        break;

    // 4. If fruit is "banana", print a message to the console
    case "banana":
        console.log("This is a banana");
        break;

    // 5. If fruit does not match any case, print a default message to the console
    default:
        console.log("Unknown fruit");
}

```

### Repetition Structures

### while loop

```jsx
// 1. Declare a variable and assign it a value
let i = 0;

// 2. Use a while loop to repeat a block of code as long as the condition is true
while (i < 3) {
    // 3. Print the value of i to the console
    console.log(i);

    // 4. Increment the value of i
    i++;
}

```

### do-while loop

```jsx
// 1. Declare a variable and assign it a value
let j = 0;

// 2. Use a do-while loop to ensure the block of code is executed at least once
do {
    // 3. Print the value of j to the console
    console.log(j);

    // 4. Increment the value of j
    j++;
} while (j < 3); // 5. Check the condition at the end of each loop iteration

```

### for loop

```jsx
// 1. Use a for loop to repeat a block of code a specified number of times
for (let k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
    // 2. Print the value of k to the console
    console.log(k);
}

```

### for...in loop

```jsx
// 1. Declare an object with some properties
const person = { name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York" };

// 2. Use a for...in loop to iterate over the properties of the object
for (let key in person) {
    // 3. Print each key and its corresponding value to the console
    console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}

```

### for...of loop

```jsx
// 1. Declare an array with some elements
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

// 2. Use a for...of loop to iterate over the values of the array
for (let fruit of fruits) {
    // 3. Print each value to the console
    console.log(fruit);
}

```

### Explanation and Breakdown

1. **Sequential Structure**
    - Statements are executed one after another in the order they appear.
    - Example: Assign a value to a variable, print it, increment the value, and print it again.

2. **Selection Structures**
    - **if statement**
        - Allows conditional execution of code blocks.
        - Example: Check if a value is greater than 5 and print messages accordingly.
    - **switch statement**
        - Selects one of many code blocks to execute based on a variable's value.
        - Example: Print different messages based on the value of a fruit variable.

3. **Repetition Structures**
    - **while loop**
        - Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.
        - Example: Print numbers 0 to 2 using a while loop.
    - **do-while loop**
        - Similar to a while loop but ensures the code block is executed at least once.
        - Example: Print numbers 0 to 2 using a do-while loop.
    - **for loop**
        - Repeats a block of code a specified number of times.
        - Example: Print numbers 0 to 2 using a for loop.
    - **for...in loop**
        - Iterates over the properties of an object.
        - Example: Print each key-value pair of an object.
    - **for...of loop**
        - Iterates over the values of an iterable object.
        - Example: Print each value of an array.

These control structures provide the necessary tools to control the flow of your program, enabling the creation of dynamic and complex behaviors.
